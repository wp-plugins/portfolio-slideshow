A shortcode that inserts a clean and simple jQuery + cycle powered slideshow of all image attachments on a post or page.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from plugins page. 

To use, upload photos to your post or page using the WordPress media uploader. Use the [portfolio_slideshow] shortcode to display the slideshow in your page or post (see screenshots for an example).

By default, the slideshow will use the large version of the image that WordPress generates when you upload an image. You can change this default in the Settings panel or on a per-slideshow basis. The image sizes available are  "thumbnail", "medium", "large", and "full".

**The shortcode supports the following attributes:**

Image size on a per-slideshow basis. Use the size attribute in the shortcode like this:

[portfolio_slideshow size=thumbnail]

Autoplay on a per-slideshow basis. Use the timeout attribute in the shortcode like this:

[portfolio_slideshow timeout=5000]

Where timeout equals the time per slide in milliseconds. Leave this out or set to 0 for the default manual advance slideshow.

Navigation thumbnails can be displayed:

[portfolio_slideshow thumbs=true] or [portfolio_slideshow thumbs=false]

Navigation links can be placed at the bottom:

[portfolio_slideshow nav=bottom] or [portfolio_slideshow nav=false] to disable navigation altogether. Slideshow will still advance with click or autoplay.

Include or exclude

[portfolio_slideshow include="1,2,3,4"]

[portfolio_slideshow exclude="1,2,3,4"]

You need to specify the attachment ID, which you can find on the media library page by hovering over the thumbnail. You can only include attachments which are attached to the current post.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==


Q: How do I insert a slideshow into a post or page?



A: Upload your photos to the post or page using the media uploader. The media uploader also allows you to assign titles and captions, sort, and delete photos. Then add the shortcode [portfolio_slideshow] where you want the slideshow to appear in the page. See screenshots 2 and 3 for an example.

One common mistake is to insert the images into the post using the content editor. This is not necessary--the plugin detects all images attached to the post and creates the slideshow automatically. 


Q: Does the plugin support images that are not uploaded via the media uploader?

A: No, the plugin does not support random folders of images or images on a third-party site. All images must be uploaded using the media uploader, which creates the database entries the plugin relies on to generate the slideshow. This behavior will not change in future versions of the plugin.


Q: Why isn't my slideshow loading?



A: If you can see the first slide, but clicking doesn't do anything, this is often caused by a jQuery library conflict. View the HTML source of the page which is supposed to show the slideshow. Do you see more than one copy of jQuery or the Cycle plugin being loaded? This plugin uses the wp_enqueue() function to load the necessary javascript libraries, which is the generally accepted way to do it. If your theme or other plugins load those same files directly, you will have a conflict.

Try disabling other plugins and switching to the default theme and see if that fixes the problem. You may need to get in touch with the author of that plugin to make sure they are loading jQuery correctly.

One other problem that I've seen is the missing "cycle" plugin. View your source to see if "jquery.cycle.all.min.js" is being loaded. If not, make sure your theme has the line <?php wp_footer() ?> in footer.php, which is where the cycle script is loaded. All themes should have this line, but every once in a while it goes missing.

Q: How do I change the size of the images?



A: By default, the slideshow uses the large-size images that are generated by WordPress when you upload an image. You can change this default in the settings panel for the plugin, or on a per-page basis using the size attribute (see installation instructions for usage).

If you would like to change the size of the images system-wide (for example, you want a large image to be 800px instead of 1025px) you can change the WordPress settings in the Settings -> Media control panel.



Q: Can you modify the plugin to do X, Y, or Z?



A: Maybe. I do try to add features based on user feedback, but only if I think it will benefit the majority of users. Please use the support forum to propose new features and I will add them to the list of ideas. I only work on this plugin in my spare time, which is limited, so unless it is an emergency it will probably take a little while to implement.

== Changelog ==

0.5.4 

* Fixed improper jQuery loading on admin introduced in previous version.

0.5.3

* Added an option to add a loading gif if your slideshows take a little while to load.

* Disabled transition "none", because of a bug in the cycle plugin. Will be added back in when the author of that plugin fixes the bug. Use the fade transition with a speed of 1ms to simulate the "none" transition.

* Added an option for "Description" field to hold a URL that links the image to an external site.

* Removed some negative padding from the auto-rezise slideshow container calculation. This may cause some themes to display too much space between the image & the page content - if so, you can add some back to your CSS file.
