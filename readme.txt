A shortcode that inserts a clean and simple jQuery + cycle powered slideshow of all image attachments on a post or page.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from plugins page. 

To use, upload photos to your post or page using the WordPress media uploader as normal. Use the [portfolio_slideshow] shortcode to display the slideshow in your page or post.

By default, the slideshow will use the large version of the images that WordPress automatically creates when you upload an image. You can change this default in the Settings panel.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==


Q: Why isn't my slideshow loading?

A: Do you see all of the images that area attached to the post, but not displayed in a slideshow format? This is often caused by a jQuery conflict. View the HTML source of the page which is supposed to show the slideshow. Do you see more than one copy of jQuery being loaded? This plugin loads the included WordPress version of jQuery, in "No Conflict" mode, which seems to be the right way to do it.

Try disabling other plugins that load jQuery and see if that fixes the problem. You may need to get in touch with the author of that plugin to make sure they are loading jQuery correctly.

Q: How do I change the size of the images?

A: The slideshow uses the large-size images that are generated by WordPress when you upload an image. You can change this default in the settings panel for the plugin.

If you would like to change the size of the images system-wide (for example, you want a large image to be 800px instead of 1025px) you can change the WordPress settings in the Settings -> Media control panel.
