A shortcode that inserts a clean and simple jQuery + cycle powered slideshow of all image attachments on a post or page.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from plugins page. There are no configuration options.

To use, upload photos to your post or page using the WordPress media uploader as normal. Instead of adding the images to the content editor, use the [portfolio_slideshow] shortcode insetad.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: How do I change the size of the images?

A: The slideshow uses the large-size images that are generated by WordPress when you upload an image. You can change the size of these images in the Settings -> Media control panel from the WordPress Dashboard. 

You can also edit the plugin file (line 28) to specify different size image for the slideshow. This configuration option will be added to a WordPress configuration panel in a future release.
